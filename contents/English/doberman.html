    <h2>Appearance</h2>
    <p>
        World breed standards are published by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale, 
        or FCI (World Canine Organisation), on the advice of the IDC (International Dobermann Club), 
        which is the Dobermann breed's governing council and has 36 countries in its member list. To become a world champion, 
        dogs are judged to FCI standards. The American Kennel Club (AKC) has its own standards, as do some other countries, 
        although most still adhere to FCI standards. 
    </p>
    <h2>Color</h2>
    <p>
        Two different color genes exist in the Dobermann: one for black (B) and one for color dilution (D). 
        There are nine possible combinations of these alleles, 
        which can result in four different color phenotypes: black, blue, red, and fawn (Isabella).

    <h2>Tail</h2>
    <p>
        The Dobermann's natural tail is fairly long, but individual dogs often have a short tail as a result of docking, 
        a procedure in which the majority of the tail is surgically removed shortly after birth.
    </p>
    <h2>Ears</h2>
    <p>
        Dobermanns often have their ears cropped, a procedure that is thought to be done for functionality for both the traditional guard duty and effective sound localization. 
        According to the Doberman Pinscher Club of America, ears are "normally cropped and carried erect".

    <h2>Intelligence</h2>
    <p>
        Canine intelligence is an umbrella term that encompasses the faculties involved in a wide range of mental tasks, 
        such as learning, problem-solving, and communication. 
        The Doberman Pinscher has been ranked amongst the most intelligent dog breeds in experimental studies and expert evaluations.
    </p>
    <h2>Aggression</h2>
    <p>
        Although they are considered to be working dogs, Dobermanns are often stereotyped as being ferocious and aggressive. 
        As a personal protection dog, the Dobermann was originally bred for these traits: it had to be large and intimidating, 
        fearless, and willing to defend its owner from attackers (especially from other guard dogs), 
        but sufficiently obedient and restrained to do so only on command.
